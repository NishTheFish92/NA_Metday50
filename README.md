# BP Medicine Advisor ðŸ’Š

## Motivation

This project was created to provide a simple and reliable blood pressure (BP) advisor for my grandmother, who experiences frequent fluctuations in her BP. The goal is to make daily BP management easier.

## Features

- **Easy-to-use interface:** Enter systolic and diastolic BP readings and select the time of measurement (morning or night).
- **Configurable thresholds:** BP thresholds and advice logic can be easily updated in the config file.
- **Accessible anywhere:** Hosted online for quick access from any device.

## How it works

1. Enter your systolic and diastolic BP readings.
2. Select whether the reading was taken in the morning or at night.
3. Click "Get Advice" to receive a recommendation on medication or dietary actions.
